# developers-italia-api for the software catalog of Developers Italia
API for the developers.italia.it public software collection

# [Description](#description)

Developers Italia API is a RESTful API that provides information about the catalog of Free and Open Source software aimed to Public Administrations.

# [Requirements](#requirements)
Developers Italia API will use:
- [PostgreSQL](https://https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Go with Fiber framework](https://gofiber.io)


# [Documentation](#documentation)

### Development
The application uses [https://github.com/cosmtrek/air](Air) for live-reloading in the development environment.
We use Docker and docker-compose to bring up the developer environment, **just clone the repo** and:

Build the container:
```bash
docker compose up
```

Wait until the Docker logs explicitly say the API is up and you can use its endpoints at http://localhost:3000/v1.
Docker compose will bring up API and PostgreSQL containers.
The application will automatically reload after a change is made.
